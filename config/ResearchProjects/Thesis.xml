        This thesis presents algorithms and data structures for computing on surfaces whose intrinsic geometry evolves over time. We take as examples the problems of mesh simplification and surface parameterizationâ€”in both cases, we find that the intrinsic perspective leads to simple algorithms which are robust and efficient on a variety of challenging examples.
