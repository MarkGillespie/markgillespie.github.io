<h3>Notes</h3>

<dt> Oct 2 2022 </dt>

    <p>I mostly followed <a href="https://www.goodto.com/recipes/gordon-ramsay-s-chickpea-samosas">this recipe</a> for the samosa filling.</p>

    <p>I also added potatoes and cauliflower. I cut the potatoes into small pieces and boiled them for about 8 minutes, and I roasted my cauliflower and cut it into small pieces. Then I added both to my samosa filling while it was sauteing. I also added a few raisins, but I don't really notice them.</p>

    <p>I followed <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/steamed-pork-buns-baozi/">this recipe</a> for the baozi dough.</p>
    <p> Except I accidentally only added 1 cup of water instead of 1.5 cups while activating the yeast. But then while mixing the dough together it got really dry, so I added some more water again (maybe another full half cup, I'm not sure).</p>
    <p>I also recommend adding a teaspoon of salt to the dough. I forgot to do that today, but I think it makes the dough taste better.</p>
