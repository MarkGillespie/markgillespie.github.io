<h2>Instructions</h2>
<div class="panel-body">

<ol class="instruction-list">
    <li>Add 100g flour and 100g water to sourdough starter to form the leaven. Leave until a spoonful of leaven floats in water (~12 hours). [Note (Nov 2021): 12 hours is way too long, at least for my old starter. Try 6 hours next time ]</li>
    <li>Put 200g leaven into a large bowl. Set aside the rest of the leaven to make more bread another day (feed it a little before putting it away). Add 300g water to the bowl, and stir until leaven mostly dissolves. Then add 500g flour. Mix to form a dry, shaggy dough. Let it sit for 30 minutes - 4 hours. This is the autolyse stage.</li>
    <li>Mix the remaining 50g water with the 2 tsp salt. Add to the dough. Let the dough sit for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Fold dough in half a few times. Then let it rest for half an hour. Repeat 5x.</li>
    <li>After the 5th time you fold the dough, let it rise until it's doubled in size (2-5h at room temperature, or overnight in the fridge).</li>
    <li>Heat oven to 450F.</li>
    <li>Put dough in a dutch oven over a sprinking of oats. Slice a slit in the top. Bake covered for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Bake uncovered for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Let cool to room temperature.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Making the Starter</h3>
    <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/yeast-shortage-life-hack/">Follow these instructions</a>
    Mix raisins with 2-3 tablespoons of water and an equal amount of flour to make a loose, wet dough. Keep the mixture warm. 12 hours later, bubbles should start to form. After 24 hours, the mixture should start to loosen. At that point, add 2-3 tablespoons more water and flour to the mixture, and after a few hours it should start producing bubbles faster.
