			<p>I designed this model by trial and error while stuck in an airport waiting for a flight which was delayed for 12 hours. Initially, I was trying to fold a regular pig, but I wound up with some extra flaps on the back, which I turned into wings!</p>

			<p> A few years ago, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR6VytS9XrU">this</a> origami card (diagrams <a href="Bird_Card_Diagrams.pdf">here</a>). I really liked it, and folded tons of them as thank you cards for various events. However, after I had given everyone I knew two or three, I figured it was time to find a new card.</p>
			<p> My google image searches didn't yield any similar cards, so I designed my own. This card is based on a macaw model I learned several years ago. I also designed a <a href="crane_card.html">card with a traditional crane on it</a>. </p>

		<description>
			<p>This origami mimic is based off of Jon Moranâ€™s <a href="https://origamiusa.org/classes/convention/2018/treasure-chest">treasure chest</a>, which I learned how to fold at his class at the 2018 OrigamiUSA convention. I grafted on some pointy teeth and modified the band pattern a little to turn the treasure chest into a mimic.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The newest in my series of greeting cards based on elementary origami models. The dog is a classic origami model for beginners, but folding it on the front of a card using only a single piece of paper is quite tricky!</p>

		<description><p>Continuing my tradition of animals with wings, I designed a winged giraffe. I'm quite happy with how it came out! The head is heavily inspired by John Montroll's horse model.</p></description>
